Researchers at MIT and IBM have successfully implemented a 127-qubit processor capable of maintaining quantum coherence for up to 100 microseconds. The breakthrough, published in Nature Physics on January 10, 2024, represents a significant step toward practical quantum supremacy. Dr. Sarah Chen, lead researcher on the project, suggests that commercial applications could emerge within 5-10 years.",
